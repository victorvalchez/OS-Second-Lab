## Operating Systems UC3M
### Second Laboratory
This lab allows the student to familiarize with the services for process management that are provided by POSIX. Moreover, one of the objectives is to understand how a Shell works in UNIX/Linux. In summary, a shell allows the user to communicate with the kernel of the Operating System using simple or chained commands.
For the management of processes, you will use the POSIX system calls such as fork, wait, exit. For process communication pipe, dup, close and signal system calls.
The student must design and implement, in C language and over the UNIX/Linux Operating System, a program that acts like a shell. The program must follow strictly the specifications and requirements that are inside this document.
